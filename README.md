# manjaro-architect
Development version of a CLI net-installer for Manjarolinux, forked from Carl Duff's Architect

This unofficial installer provides netinstallation for different manjaro editions. It sources the iso-profiles git repo, so it should be always up to date. 

Currently under heavy construction.
